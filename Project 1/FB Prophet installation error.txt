At the wrong when update jupyterlab
RemoveError: 'setuptools' is a dependency of conda and always be removed from conda' s operating environment.
Try the first method:
PIP uninstall install setuptools
and conda install setuptools , useless, still an error
The second:
conda update conda
no, at the same error
The third:
conda update -- force conda
success, no error.
Conda install numpy, numpy, numpy, numpy, numpy, numpy, numpy. Looks like it worked out.



I had faced same problem. I used "conda" rather than "pip" for installation with steps shown below and it worked magical for me.

step 1: conda install -c anaconda ephem

step 2:conda install -c conda-forge pystan

step 3: conda install -c conda-forge fbprophet

Now you can go ahead with : "from fbprophet import Prophet" in python environment.
