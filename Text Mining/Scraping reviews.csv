  I was looking to buy a desktop PC and found this introductory offer which was irresistible. Decided to buy this product and I am extremely happy with it. I am writing this review after a heavy usage of 20+ days.I have played graphic intense games like NFS Heat, Hitman 2, Microsoft Flight simulator 2020 and Metro Exodus. Games run flawlessly. Only thing I felt was that NFS heat was lagging a bit with high graphic setting as they recommend 16gb ram.Apart from this, I am using Adobe After Effects and Cyberlink Power director. 4k Video editing has never been this smooth before.Only upgradration I am thinking of currently is to install another 8gb of ram so that it really helps my applications. Or else for most of the games and applications, 8gb of ram is more than sufficient.As it was an introductory offer from Lenovo, I got this product at a super price(INR 88.5k). I noticed that they hiked the price few times and eventually it went out of stock. Get this product without any thoughts, in case it comes back in stock. You will be  a super happy user like all other reviewers here.Pros:-Latest 10th gen Intel Core i7 processor-Monster Nvidia RTX 2060 which takes care of all high end graphics requirements smoothly-3 years of warranty from a branded companyCons:I cannot think of any, apart from the fan noise when the graphic card is subjected to heavy use (unavoidable as it has to manage the heat dissipation efficiently)

  Two days since purchased this product on prime day offer (~90K).i7 10th gen  + RTX2060 at this price was a surprise and have been using for two days really happy with the product.Even If I purchase all components individually and assemble it would cost the same(may be 5K less).But you get brand and warranty etc, no hassle of bothering about cooling etc.Checked today again for non-primeday price, the product is out of stock.. do not know if it would be available again due to political situation and lenovo being Chinese company.

  I have considered buying this product on Amazon day @88.5K but decided against it as I decided the CPU and GPU combination is very mismatched for gaming. You want to buy a gaming rig make sure that both CPU and GPU are evenly matched. Trust me when I say this rig will always be GPU bound. This i7 should be paired up with a RTX 2080 ti to be effectively used or atleast a 2070S. Again people will say that I can upgrade my graphic card down the line with a faster one, but look at the power supply it's only 380W. You need to change that.The only worthwhile component in this PC is the processor and rest you need to upgrade within 2 year, may be immediately for the RAM.So if you are buying this for gaming I would suggest to build it on your own. There are pretty decent options available online now a days like ant-pc, bitkart and elelctrobot.If you want a PC for both wfh and casual gaming I would recommend buy the i5 version instead as that rig is much more balanced with a 1600S which is enough for 1080p gaming.If you are looking to buy the PC for CPU heavy productivity work then this is a perfect rig for you as it comes with brand warranty.

  RAM XMP profile in BIOS unavailable. Hence even if you want to upgrade RAM by another 8GB (say Hyperx 3200 Mghz), it will only give you 2400. That is a big negative. Good product otherwise so far.

  Reviewing after a month usage.I was looking for video editing and gaming purpose system and this delivers all that.Was about to buy ASUS system but this comes with additional/latest hardware(WIFI6) with extra bucks.And also wanted to near future proof as it comes with 10th gen processor.I missed the launch price which was around 89k and purchased at 95,490 using ICICI Amazon card at no cost EMI for 6 months plus 3,778.36 discount so in total I paid only  91,711.64I use Filmora for video editing and to render a 10 min video it takes around 3- minute which is quick and tried games like Watchdogs2, Hyperscape and it runs very smooth at high/ultra settings. Thanks to NVIDIA RTX 2060 6GB which can handle nearly 95% games available in market right now it is based on Turing™ architecture, bringing incredible performance and the power of real-time ray tracing and AI to the latest games and to every gamer. RTX. It’s On.Pre-installed software / offers - Lifetime W10 Home, Lenovo Vantage, McAfee(1 month trail), Free one month Xbox game ultimate games pass subscription, Free one year dropbox subscription.Noise: There are two display ports to connect to CPU, standard or direct to graphics card. When plugged into motherboard port it doesn't make any noise and when plugged into graphics card port it still doesn't make noise unless you are on high gaming.Lookwise it is small and simple. No gaming ROG vibes here.I bough Acer gaming 24 inc LED IPS monitor for this systemWill keep updating review.

  Great PC, has very tight specs with no big overkills in hardware. Great mid-range option that just works. I am getting 60-90 FPS in ultra settings on multiple AAA titles @ 1080p. I have no ambition of 1440p or 4k gaming, it is just way to expensive in my opinion - which even if I could afford I don't really have the time for :)This is a great deal. Especially during the GFX card shortage on 2021 due to the bull run in cryptocurrency - a RTX  2060 Super is either out of stock or scalpers are selling at INR 50k! (as on March 2021) and this will only get worse! This config should easily last for 3 years for the 1080p gaming crowd who do not want to boil the ocean.

  Great performance but cheated on promised 3+2 years extended warranty. Tps tech informed lenovo cannot give extended warranty beyond 3 years,3 years DEFAULT WARRANTY was only thing.But I am being long standing PRIME MEMBER never thought AMAZON REPRESENTATIVE on recorded line will give FALSE INFORMATION.I ASKED THE AMAZON CUSTOMER CARE SPECIFICALLY.He said 3+2 years extended (paying 2999/- ) extra .TPS REFUNDED THE MONEY BUT THE FEELING OF GETTING FALSE PROMISE made me very INSECURE in Amazon.U just CANNOT TRUST Amazon representative.

  The Desktop is very good with excellent performance with small front-print. Played Games Asphalt and monitored CPU looks to be okay , will update more in coming days

  Was sceptical at first thinking about balance between CPU and GPU and overclocking and all.But when I played games like Shadow of Mordor etc I found it better than expected.It performs well and is easily latest configuration coming at good price.

"

  It work fantastic, I am using it for a while. The system is really good

"
"

  I'm super happy with this product. i needed a high tech pc that could easily support some of the games that needed higher configuration to run and this pc in that case has ticked all the boxes. out of all the pc's that are available on amazon this one really stands out in the case of price and specs. overall its a great product that i highly recommend.

  FOR 3D DESIGNING ITS PERFORMANCE GREAT

  Good one

"

  I use this desktop for light gaming and coding, I have absolutely no complaints. The only issue is finding the right ram for expansion as I am not able to find one rated 2933mhz other than that I would say just go buy it.

  Its amazing. Go for it without second thought.

  I got this delivered yesterday by amazon. Upon checking I found that HDD is missing. As per the configuration 1TB HDD is included. I don't see it.

  If u are looking for a price to performance then just don't buy it for the 95k u get a lot performnce machine with custom build,the Mobo look horrible as it is all green pcb and also the power supply is not 80+ as i can see from the wires and also the processor is not unlocked so u can't overclock it. And i don't think lenovo mobo can make u do overclock on processor apart from that rtx 2060 is not performance to the mark and with this type of gpu u atleast need 16gb ram which u didn't get so don't waste ur money in buying this..go for custom build.

  Was going to buy this but ended up going against it after doing some research. The only thing good about this system is its CPU and GPU, but even so, the GPU is very under-powered compared to the CPU. You might as well pair it up with a i5-9400f for better results.Most importantly are the rest of the components. The motherboard is some cheap Lenovo one, the case is horrible with poor air flow; And, because of its small size, it will be very hard to look for upgrades to go along with it. The 380W PSU is barely enough for this system and will have to be swapped further down the road if you're looking to upgrade.Ultimately, it's way more convenient and cost efficient to purchase from PC building sites/shops, like AntPC, VoltedPC, SMC International, Bitkart etc. where you'll get WAY more value for money as well as future-proof your PC.

  lenovo have made an excellent machine of an i7 10th gen with an NVIDIA RTX 2060  6GB which is worth about 1.6 lk  inr or 2200 USD but this monster is now only 81k inr or 1080 usd which is a stealeven the monitor is really cheap its a 27"" and a 165hz refresh rate which is worth like 35 k inr or 450 usd but you gettin it for 20k inr or 260 usdperformance will be spectacular. it has a great cpu , graphic card, memorybut the ram is not upto the point but it is pretty cheap you could just add some external ram on thisbuying this in a month and wait for a review then

  This product is overpriced.just 256 gb ssd.this product is not good.1 lakh computer with noob specs. Its not value for money.

  Stuck at home? Laptops hardly serve their portable purpose. Spend ur money on this amazing desktop instead. Work and play all in one. U won’t regret it!!

  It is of ₹95000 on Amazon in India but on the offline stores the price was above ₹110000 and about the performance the performance of my older laptop of asus which was having the price of 4lakh was good but this is cheaper and gives you better output not only for gaming but also for coding (C++ or C#) it's better than my laptop and not only coding game development, graphic design and theoretical operation to be done in nasa or large problems of mathematics can also be done on it.So,In short the pc is good.....().Thank you ()Mr.XYZ
